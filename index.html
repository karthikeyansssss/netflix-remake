                <div class="content">
                    <p>Netflix is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service. The service primarily distributes original and acquired films and television shows from various genres, and it is available internationally in multiple languages.
                        Launched on January 16, 2007, nearly a decade after Netflix, Inc. began its pioneering DVD‑by‑mail movie rental service, Netflix is the most-subscribed video on demand streaming media service, with 260.28 million paid memberships in more than 190 countries as of January 2024.</p>

                <label for="first">How much cost does Netflix cost?</label>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Netflix pricing starts at $7 a month, but following the latest Netflix price hike in October, to get the best video quality without ads you have to pay $23 a month. And due to Netflix's recent crackdown on password sharing in the US, it now costs an additional $8 a month to add an extra user to your account.</p>

                <label for="first">Is Netflix good for kids?</label>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>The Netflix Kids experience is just as rounded as the regular version. This means it offers great value for your money. The categories of movies and shows are just as vast, ranging from "Early Learning" shows to action and regular animation. There's a wide range of content that is educational and fun, but still child-friendly.
